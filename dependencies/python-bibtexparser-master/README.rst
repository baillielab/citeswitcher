History and evolutions
----------------------

The original source code was part of bibserver from `OKFN <http://github.com/okfn/bibserver>`_. This project is released under the AGPLv3. OKFN and the original authors kindly provided the permission to use a subpart of their project (ie the bibtex parser) under LGPLv3. Many thanks to them!

The parser evolved to a new core based on pyparsing.
