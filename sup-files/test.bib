The aim of this study was to assess the role of tocilizumab in reducing the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received standard of care treatment.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}This retrospective, observational cohort study included adults ({$\geq$}18 years) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to tertiary care centres in Bologna and Reggio Emilia, Italy, between Feb 21 and March 24, 2020, and a tertiary care centre in Modena, Italy, between Feb 21 and April 30, 2020. All patients were treated with the standard of care (ie, supplemental oxygen, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, antiretrovirals, and low molecular weight heparin), and a non-randomly selected subset of patients also received tocilizumab. Tocilizumab was given either intravenously at 8 mg/kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 800 mg) in two infusions, 12 h apart, or subcutaneously at 162 mg administered in two simultaneous doses, one in each thigh (ie, 324 mg in total), when the intravenous formulation was unavailable. The primary endpoint was a composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death.

After adjustment for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and SOFA score, tocilizumab treatment was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}61, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}40\textendash 0{$\cdot$}92; p=0{$\cdot$}020). 24 (13\%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab were diagnosed with new infections, versus 14 (4\%) of 365 patients treated with standard of care alone (p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Treatment with tocilizumab, whether administered intravenously or subcutaneously, might reduce the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}None.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We aimed to examine whether mavrilimumab, an anti-granulocyte\textendash macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor-{$\alpha$} monoclonal antibody, added to standard management, improves clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}This single-centre prospective cohort study included patients aged 18 years or older who were admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxia, and systemic hyperinflammation. Patients received a single intravenous dose (6 mg/kg) of mavrilimumab added to standard care given by the hospital at the time. The control group consisted of contemporaneous patients with similar baseline characteristics who received standard care at the same hospital. The main outcome was time to clinical improvement (defined as improvement of two or more points on the seven-point ordinal scale of clinical status). Other outcomes included proportion of patients achieving clinical improvement, survival, mechanical ventilation-free survival, and time to fever resolution. Adverse events were monitored daily.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between March 17 and April 15, 2020, 13 non-mechanically ventilated patients (median age 57 years [IQR 52\textendash 58], 12 [92\%] men) received mavrilimumab and 26 patients (median age 60 [IQR 53\textendash 67], 17 [65\%] men) in the control group received standard care. During the 28-day follow-up, no patients in the mavrilimumab group died, and seven (27\%) patients in the control group died (p=0{$\cdot$}086). At day 28, all patients in the mavrilimumab group and 17 (65\%) patients in the control group showed clinical improvement (p=0{$\cdot$}030), with earlier improvement in the mavrilimumab than in the control group (mean time to improvement 8 days [IQR 5 to 11] \emph{vs} 19 days [11 to {$>$}28], p=0{$\cdot$}0001). By day 28, one (8\%) patient in the mavrilimumab group progressed to mechanical ventilation compared with nine (35\%) patients in the control group who progressed to mechanical ventilation or died (p=0{$\cdot$}14). By day 14, fever resolved in ten (91\%) of 11 febrile patients in the mavrilimumab group, compared with 11 (61\%) of 18 febrile patients in the control group (p=0{$\cdot$}18); fever resolution was faster in mavrilimumab recipients versus controls (median time to resolution 1 day [IQR 1 to 2] \emph{vs} 7 days [3 to {$>$}14], p=0{$\cdot$}0093). Mavrilimumab was well tolerated, with no infusion reactions. Three (12\%) patients in the control group developed infectious complications.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Mavrilimumab treatment was associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with standard care in non-mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation.
