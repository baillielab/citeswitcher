 abstract = {Regulated transcription controls the diversity, developmental pathways and spatial organization of the hundreds of cell types that make up a mammal. Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We find that few genes are truly `housekeeping', whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed of several closely separated TSSs, with independent cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved. Promoter-based expression analysis reveals key transcription factors defining cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions of identified novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression and sample ontology enrichment analyses. The functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5 (FANTOM5) project provides comprehensive expression profiles and functional annotation of mammalian cell-type-specific transcriptomes with wide applications in biomedical research.},

 abstract = {Background\textemdash\textvisiblespace{}2A-Adrenoceptors (\textvisiblespace{}2A-ARs) have important roles in sympathetic cardiovascular regulation. Variants of ADRA2A affect gene transcription and expression and are associated with insulin release and risk for type 2 diabetes. We examined whether ADRA2A variants are also associated with cardiovascular responses to the selective \textvisiblespace{}2-ARagonist dexmedetomidine. Methods and Results\textemdash{}Seventy-three healthy subjects participated in a placebo-controlled, single-blind study. After 3 infusions of placebo, subjects received 3 incremental infusions of dexmedetomidine (cumulative dose, 0.4 ␮g/kg). Primary outcomes were changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations, measured as difference of the area-under-the-curve during placebo and dexmedetomidine infusions ($\varhexagonlrbonds$AUC). We used multiple linear regression analysis to examine the associations between 9 ADRA2A tagging variants and 5 inferred haplotypes and $\varhexagonlrbonds$AUC after adjustment for covariates. Homozygous carriers of rs553668 and the corresponding haplotype 4, previously associated with increased \textvisiblespace{}2A-AR expression, had a 2.2-fold greater decrease in AUCSBP after dexmedetomidine (adjusted Pϭ0.006); similarly, the maximum decrease in SBP was 24.7Ϯ8.1 mm Hg compared with 13.6Ϯ5.9 mm Hg in carriers of the wild-type allele (Pϭ0.007). Carriers of haplotype 3, previously associated with reduced \textvisiblespace{}2A-AR expression, had a 44\% smaller decrease in AUCSBP (Pϭ0.013). Haplotype information significantly improved the model predicting the decrease in SBP (PϽ0.001). There were similar but nonsignificant trends for diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Genotypes were not significantly associated with norepinephrine responses. Conclusions\textemdash{}Common ADRA2A variants are associated with the hypotensive response to dexmedetomidine. Effects of specific variants/haplotypes in vivo are compatible with their known effects on gene expression in vitro. (Circ Cardiovasc Genet. 2011;4:179-187.)},

@article{SchroderConservationdivergenceTolllike2012,
 abstract = {Evolutionary change in gene expression is generally considered to be a major driver of phenotypic differences between species. We investigated innate immune diversification by analyzing interspecies differences in the transcriptional responses of primary human and mouse macrophages to the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS). By using a custom platform permitting cross-species interrogation coupled with deep sequencing of mRNA 5' ends, we identified extensive divergence in LPS-regulated orthologous gene expression between humans and mice (24\% of orthologues were identified as "divergently regulated"). We further demonstrate concordant regulation of human-specific LPS target genes in primary pig macrophages. Divergently regulated orthologues were enriched for genes encoding cellular "inputs" such as cell surface receptors (e.g., TLR6, IL-7R$\alpha$) and functional "outputs" such as inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (e.g., CCL20, CXCL13). Conversely, intracellular signaling components linking inputs to outputs were typically concordantly regulated. Functional consequences of divergent gene regulation were confirmed by showing LPS pretreatment boosts subsequent TLR6 responses in mouse but not human macrophages, in keeping with mouse-specific TLR6 induction. Divergently regulated genes were associated with a large dynamic range of gene expression, and specific promoter architectural features (TATA box enrichment, CpG island depletion). Surprisingly, regulatory divergence was also associated with enhanced interspecies promoter conservation. Thus, the genes controlled by complex, highly conserved promoters that facilitate dynamic regulation are also the most susceptible to evolutionary change.},

 abstract = {Objective Clonidine is an a2-adrenoceptor agonist which, by coupling with G-protein, has been proposed as an alternative treatment for refractory ascites of patients with cirrhosis for several years. Genetic polymorphisms of b-adrenoceptor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been reported to affect drug response in patients with cirrhosis. This study evaluated the clonidineediuretic response rate, favourable predictors and genetic components of the clonidineediuretic response in patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites. Methods 270 patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites were randomised equally into two treatment groups to receive diuretics alone or the clonidineediuretics association. The primary end point was clonidineediuretic response rate. Secondary end points were mean daily dose of diuretics, times of paracentesis, ascites-related readmission and 1-year survival rate. Results Good clonidine responders had better natriuresis and diuresis as well as a significant decrease in abdominal circumference, plasma renin, aldosterone and norepinephrine levels. The overall clonidineediuretics response rate was 55e60\%. In patients with cirrhosis, the prevalence of ARDA2C WD/DD and GNB3 CT/TT genotypes was 71\% and 77\%, respectively. Among the responders, 71\% of patients with cirrhosis had the ARDA2C WD/DD genotype and 67\% has the GNB3 CT/TT genotype. Besides higher baseline norepinephrine levels, the presence of both ARDA2C WD/DD and GNB3 CT/TT genotypes showed a positive predictive value of 82\% and a negative predictive value of 79\% for good clonidine response. Conclusions These results suggest that neurohormonal and genetic testing may be used as predictive factors for the additive effects of clonidine on the diuresis and natriuresis effects of diuretics in patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites.},
