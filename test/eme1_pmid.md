Background 
==========

In mid-2018 we will start an HTA-commissioned (16/93/01) three-arm, parallel-group, open-label, randomized clinical trial to establish whether either of the alpha_2-adrenoreceptor agonists (alpha_2-agonists) dexmedetomidine or clonidine are superior to usual care (propofol) as primary sedative agents in mechanically ventilated patients (‘A2B trial’). The question posed by the HTA commission was would alpha_2-agonists compared to propofol improve clinical outcomes due to their potentially superior sedative properties, albeit with uncertain safety and cost-effectiveness. 

However, alpha_2-agonists are also known to have extensive immune-modulating effects in both *in vitro* and *in vivo* model systems relating to critical illness[@Effectsdexmedetomidineratio2014; PMID:19691839]. Since immune mechanisms precipitate and perpetuate organ failure in critical illness, immunodulatory effects may mediate the potential beneficial clinical effects of these agents in critically ill patients.

If the A2B trial shows any clinical effect from treatment with alpha_2-agonists, this important mechanistic question will immediately follow: is the effect due to the sedative or immunodulatory effects of these drugs? Using a single RNA-derived composite measure of alpha_2-agonist immunodulation, we can provide robust statistical evidence to answer this question.

The randomisation in the A2B trial provides a unique instrumental variable to evaluate the causal effects of inflammatory pathways on key outcomes in human critical illness, and pharmacogenomic determinants of efficacy and complications of therapy with alpha_2-agonists.

There is evidence that specific, testable genetic variants in both the metabolic pathways, and the receptor site of action for alpha_2-agonists, may have a strong effect on the individual-level probability of specific clinical outcomes. If it were possible to predict a high probability of delirium, secondary infection or accidental extubation due to insufficient sedative load, then pharmacogenomic data may have a direct application in the clinical use of these drugs. In the context of the A2B trial, this data is simple and cheap to obtain.

Outcomes 
--------------

In the A2B trial our primary outcome is the clinically and economically important ‘time to successful extubation’, which is strongly affected by underlying inflammatory disease processes [ref]. Inflammatory pathways also have important effects on key secondary outcomes in the trial, including delirium[@extremeendpsychoneuroimmunological2013], mortality, and cognitive decline[@AssociationDeliriumCognitive2017]



Modulatable immune activation in critical illness  
--------------------------------------------------

Organ failure is the defining feature of critical illness. Immune mechanisms are believed to play a causative role in organ failure from multiple distinct precipitants, including sepsis, burns, trauma, haemorrhage, pancreatitis and others. In each of these conditions, inflammatory organ damage can occur at sites *remote* from the initial injury. Our recent systematic review [ref] demonstrates that alpha_2-agonists...

Delirium
---------

Delirium is a complex multifactorial clinical phenotype, with high prevalence during critical illness, and is a key secondary trial outcome in A2B. Delirium is strongly associated with multiple clinically important adverse outcomes from critical illness, including mortality and subsequent cognitive impairment. Significant evidence supports a lower delirium incidence with alpha_2-agonist based sedation. Inflammation is strongly associated with delirium, but intervention studies in humans - necessary to infer causation - are lacking. Elucidating the mechanism by which alpha_2-agonistsalter delirium could give novel insights into delirium pathogenesis and potential future therapies.

In addition to direct sedative effects on the central nervous system, alpha_2-agonistsmodulate a variety of inflammator signals *in vivo*[@Effectsdexmedetomidineratio2014; PMID:19691839]. We hypothesise that detectable, modifiable inflammator signals in peripheral blood cause delirium in some patients[@Systemicinfectioninflammation2009].

Quantifying inflammation
------------------------

In order to demonstrate causal relationships between immune activity and clinical outcomes, it will be necessary to quantify immune activation. More specifically, we need to quantify the component of immune activity that is modifiable by alpha_2 agonists. The requires the measurement of multiple relevant mediators identified by our systematic reivew. The genes for these mediators are expressed in cell-type and context-specific patterns. We therefore propose to decompose this complex multidimensional signal to a single composite measure of modifiable immune activation (MAI)

Pharmacogenomics
----------------

The safety and efficacy of medication practice is at least partly determined genetically.  CPIC dosing guidelines[[relling_cpic_2011]], based on pretreatment testing for multiple single gene-drug interactions, exist for 100 drugs [[noauthor_pharmgkb_nodate], #[whirl-carrillo_pharmacogenomics_2012]] and there is RCT evidence for a limited number of guidelines [[price_pharmacogenomic_2013]].  There are identified alleles for both dexmedetomidine [[PMID:23337848, PMID:21104443, PMID:21325151]] and clonidine [[nurnberger_effect_2003, yang_association_2010]] which affect the metabolism or molecular pathways of the drugs, and which are associated with differential treatment efficacy (DTE) in groups of patients which are identifiable pretreatment.  Estimates of this DTE are imprecise.  Realising the benefit of genomic testing relies on reducing cost of the test and applying it reliably to treatment decisions [[graves_value_2017]]. Because of heterogeneity in the whole genome [[the_1000_genomes_project_consortium_global_2015]] and the interaction with varying clinical characteristics, a personalised absolute effect estimate must use information from a simultaneous model of clinical and genomic covariates to overcome this heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE).  Replicated, unbiased observations on alternative treatments are necessary to calculate the absolute effect of a personalised treatment decision and the A2B trial hence offers a mechanism to determine the absolute risk attributable to a gene for individuals in the trial, explaining both DTE and HTE and improving the precision for such personalised estimates for future patients. 
Specific hypothesese:
- alpha 2 adrenoreceptor gene, association with delirium or complications 
- metabolic genes

Hypotheses 
==========

1. Although A2B is primarily a study of sedation strategies, we hypothesise that clinically important effects are significantly mediated through modification of systemic inflammation. 
2. Specific genetic variants determine the required dose and individual propensity to complications of therapy with alpha_2-agonists.

Aims 
====

Test in the A2B trial whether inflammatory signals are   1. modified by both alpha_2-agonists, *and*    2. associated with a reduction in time to extubation, delirium, or mortality.] 

Study design 
============

In order to inform a hypothesis-testing study in patients, we will collate published studies of effects of alpha_2-agonistson transcript and cytokine production in immune cells from any species, and perform a short series of *in vitro* experiments in primary donor leukocytes exposed to alpha_2-agonists at therapeutically-relevant doses. In this phase, gene expression will be assayed using 5'-end RNA sequencing (CAGE) to resolve regulatory signalling, as we have shown previously[PMID:24670764]. Signals will be systematically collapsed onto human gene names using publicly-available annotation and orthology data, as in our previous work [PMID:22451944]. We will use a novel circular crossvalidation algorithm to priorities candidate mediators. We anticipate that this will yield a shortlist of 20-50 genes and cytokines.

In order to detect the biological effect of treatment we will obtain a single blood sample at 48-72h after randomisation from all consenting patients in the A2B trial. In order to cost-effectively measure multiple transcripts arising from distinct genomic regions, RNA-seq and multiplex cytokine assays will be performed in a randomly-selected subset of 300 patients, 100 from each of the study groups. For each gene or cytokine in that shortlist of hypothesised alpha_2-agonist-responsive factors, we will quantify evidence for causality by combining (a) statistical evidence for a difference between treatment and control groups and (b) statistical evidence for an association with outcome after adjusting for other measured characteristics. After stringent correction for multiple comparisons we will identify causative mediators for specific outcomes. Inflammatory signals identified in this instrumental variable analysis will either lie on the causal pathway between alpha_2-agonistsand key outcomes, or will be biomarkers (in this biological context) for causative processes occurring outside of the scope of our measurements (e.g. unmeasured mediators in blood, immune cells in solid organs, direct effects on the central nervous system).

In the pharmacodynamic component specific genetic loci to be sequenced include those relevant to dexmedetomidine (PRKCB gene at site rs9922316, ADRA2A at site rs1800544) and clonidine (ADRA2C gene at site rs11269124 and GNB3 at site rs5443), where defined substitutions have demonstrated associations with sedative or haemodynamic effects in clinical populations, and [others where mechanistic evidence exists prior to determining clinical outcomes for immune pathways].  It is most likely that the tested alleles will influence the required dose of drug to achieve the constant target of clinical effect, whether by altering effect site concentrations or determining the required concentration to produce a given effect, so the main endpoint for the pharmacogenomic systemic exposure to drug (AUC of dose recorded in process evaluation).  It is also likely that the tested alleles have distinct effects on sedative, neurologic, immune and haemodynamic effects of alpha_2-agonists.  We will therefore also determine the rate of adverse effects as associated with these alleles, including major adverse cardiovascular effects, delirium itself, and alteration of infusion rate due to adverse haemodynamic effects.
